# Implementation Simplification

## What Was Removed

- **Fast Path Logic**: Single-line fix attempt using `generateText()`
- **Dual Strategy Complexity**: Two different code paths for error handling
- **Line-specific Error Parsing**: Complex logic to identify "line X" errors

## What Remains

- **Unified Multi-Step Approach**: Single `streamText()` path for all errors
- **AI SDK v5 Best Practices**: Full utilization of modern AI SDK features
- **Proven Performance**: Already demonstrated efficiency (1 step, 638 tokens)

## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Reduced Complexity**: 60+ lines of code removed
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same reliable flow for all error types
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single code path to debug and enhance
4. **Better AI SDK v5 Alignment**: Focus on `streamText()` capabilities

## Performance Impact

- **None**: Multi-step approach already optimal for most cases
- **Improvement**: Simplified logs and debugging
- **Future-Ready**: Better foundation for AI SDK v5 enhancements

The implementation is now cleaner, more maintainable, and fully aligned with AI SDK v5 best practices.
